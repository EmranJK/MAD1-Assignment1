# MAD1-Assignment1

IMPORTANT NOTE:
I checked the project for the last time one day before the dead line (Sunday) and I had to do some changes to build.gradle.
This was due to some errors that appeared after I updated corretto 11 and now the errors dispappeared and the app is back to work exactly as before.
The latest app tagged release contains the old build.gradle before these changes.
I did this fix in the commit before the last but I gave the commit the wrong name by accident, the commit is called "Fixed the tests".

After reviewing the video after I uploaded it, I found out that the video lags when I try to show the tests passing, 
so here is an image of tests passing:
