# MAD1-Assignment1

IMPORTANT NOTE:
I checked the project for the last time one day before the dead line (Sunday) and I had to do some changes to build.gradle.

This was due to some errors that appeared after I updated corretto 11 and now the errors dispappeared and the app is back to work exactly as before.

The latest app tagged release contains the old build.gradle before these changes.

I did this fix in a commit called "Fixed the tests" made on the 23 of October, I gave it that name by mistake

I also did a second short demo video just to show that the assignment is working fine and as before even after I added the changes to build.gradle and I put the link in the word document that I submitted

Here is a screenshot of the tests passing, I tried to show that in the first demo but the video lagged when I showed it in the video:
